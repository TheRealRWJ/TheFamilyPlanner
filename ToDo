This list still needs some attention

## To Do 
- Store settings to file
- Read settings from file
- move coded account info to settings file
- secure pivate date like url, APIs, Usernames ...
- Fix layout on small screens. Order of content needs to be changed, so more important info resides on top of the page
- Enable plugins
- Get data from necxtcloud in a secure way. Dont like current usage of public calendars and tasks
- Get picture of planned meals out of mealy 
-  uploade the code
...

this might take a while. dont have much time at the moment
other priorities pull me away from this project
thanks for your patience. I think it will be worth it
